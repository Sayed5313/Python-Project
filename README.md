Hypertension, often referred to as the "silent killer," remains a leading global health concern, affecting over 1.3 billion individuals worldwide and significantly contributing to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study explores advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies to enhance the early detection and prediction of hypertension. Leveraging a multi-modal dataset comprising ballistocardiography (BCG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and ultrasound (US) signals, we employ rigorous preprocessing techniques, including outlier handling and class balancing via SMOTE and ADASYN. Feature selection methods such as ANOVA, Chi-Square, PCA, and RFE refine critical predictors, while models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines demonstrate robust performance. Hyperparameter optimization ensures peak efficacy, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of 89.98%. The study highlights the importance of model interpretability, emphasizing its clinical relevance through techniques like SHAP and LIME. By addressing challenges in accessibility, scalability, and real-world applicability, this research establishes a foundation for integrating AI-driven hypertension detection systems into clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. These findings underscore the transformative potential of machine learning in mitigating the global burden of hypertension.
